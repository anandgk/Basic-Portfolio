						Hello, I am a backend developer and currently learning the cool awesome web stack technology skills at Rutgers Boot Camp.  
					</p>

					<p class="longtxt">
						I currently work at RBC in Jersey City, managing number of Financial Product Control and Regulatory Reporting applications. In between project work and when time permits, I collaborate with team members from other projects within Finance in learning and understanding what they do and also the technologies that they use for developing their applications. Lately I have been learning Hadoop using JAVA and Python.
					</p>

					<p class="longtxt">
						In my sparetime, I spend lot of time on photography. I love taking photographs of nature and cities. When I see something beautiful and eye catching, I love to photograph it. My friends and family have sometimes called me crazy when I spend so much time perfecting a single photo shot. I also get so much facinated by Science, Technology and Space Exploration. The very thought that there is a gigantic stretch of unexplored space beyond the limited visible sky sparks that certain curiosity and is so overwhelming to even think, what is out there.
